	<comment>LogBrowser is a Google-like search application but limited on log files.
    Normally each line in a log file starts with a timestamp followed by
    the log level, some other information and at least the log message.
    The LogBrowser has an own analyzer which is (more or less) optimized
    for this task.
    A typical question for searching inside log files could be
    &quot;Where is the log file containing the transaction id 4711?&quot; or
    &quot;What happens on the Friday, 13th between 13:13 and 13:15?&quot;</comment>
